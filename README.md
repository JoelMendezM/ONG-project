# ONG - Somos Más

This is a website created by a React JS developers team (9 people) - The idea was born by [Alkemy company](https://www.alkemy.org/) which builds a react template project and assigned a mentor (Sr. developer) for the team. The mentor designated tickets to each developer using "Jira" software to build the whole App
